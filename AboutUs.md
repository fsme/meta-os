# About Me #

My name is Andrew. I was born at 1970. I worked as the programmer since 1987. My resume is [here](http://andr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/en/).

Now I homeless. I was ruined at the stock exchange at 2008. I live into my old truck Ford Transit. I earn by freight traffic, but almost all money leaves on repair of this truck. I don't work as programmer now because drivers in Russia earn more. Also I can't  live into computer, it is too small now.

I have no time quickly to develop this project.

Have patience.
